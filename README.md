# Pomodoro Timer App

The Pomodoro Timer App is a simple time management tool built using Python's `tkinter` library. The app helps you manage your work and breaks using the Pomodoro Technique, allowing you to focus on tasks for specific time intervals followed by short breaks.

## Features

- Countdown timer for work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks.
- Keeps track of completed work sessions with checkmarks.
- Start and reset buttons to control the timer.

## Usage

1. Run the application
   
3. The main window of the app will appear with a countdown timer and buttons to control the timer.

4. Click the "Start" button to begin a Pomodoro work session. The timer will count down for the specified work duration.

5. After each work session, a short break or long break will be automatically initiated, depending on the number of work sessions completed.

6. The checkmark symbols will indicate completed work sessions. A checkmark will be added for every two completed work sessions.

7. You can manually reset the timer and checkmarks by clicking the "Reset" button.

## Customization
